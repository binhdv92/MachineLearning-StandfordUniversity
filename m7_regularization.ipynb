    "**The Strategy**: \n",
    "To prevent **overfitting**, we modify the `Cost Function` of the model. We don't mean to punish the model for being inccurate; but we punish it for having large parameter values ($\\theta$).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Logic**:\n",
    "- **Large $\\theta$ values** create \"aggressive\" curves that over-react to noise in the data.\n",
    "- **Small $\\theta$ values** force those same curves to become flatter and smoother.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Benefit**: \n",
    "By making the parameters smaller, the model simplifies its own hypothesis. It retains all available features but \"mutes\" their intensity, resulting in a curve that ignores random fuctuations and focuses on the true underlying trend. This allows the models to **generalize** (performing accurately on new data rather than just memorizing the training set).\n"
